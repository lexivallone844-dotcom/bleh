# Day 1 

## Test Overview

- Identify the phases of Penetration Test
- Plan and scope a Penetration Test at an "entry level"
- Write a formal report

## Pen Testing

### Phase 1 : Mission Definition

- Define mission goals and targets
- Determine scope of mission
- Define the entworks that are valid targets
- Determine which machines are valid targets
- Determine the attacks or exploits that are authorized/appropriate
- Define RoE

### Phase 2: Recon

- Gather info about the target through public sources
- Examine websites, job postings, search engines, etc.
- Enumberate withou ttouching the target


### Phase 3: Footprinting

- Accumulate data throug scanning and/or interaction with the target resources


### Phase 4 : Exploitation/Initial Access

- Gain initial foothold into target network

### Phase 5 : Post-exploitation

- Establish persistence
- escalate priveleges
- obfuscate
- cover your tracks
- exfilrate target data

### Phase 6 : Document Mission

  - Document and report mission details


# Exploitation Research

- Find the os that is running on the computer and be able to do OSINT reasearch on it.

- Ex: you run uname -a (Linux) or ip config /all (Windows) and get a  **ubuntu 4.8.0-41 kernel**, you will just google **ubuntu 4.8.0-41 kernel vulnerabilities**
